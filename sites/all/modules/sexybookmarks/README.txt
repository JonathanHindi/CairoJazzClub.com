The SexyBookmarks module is a port of the WordPress plug-in by the same name.

The sole aim was to stray away from the "in the box" thinking behind most social
bookmarking plugins, and add a little flair that would entice your readers,
rather than deterring them with microscopic icons that get lost in pages heavy
laden with content.

SexyBookmarks was ported and is maintained by Stuart Clark (deciphered).
